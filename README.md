# Banan Al-Jarrah Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built with the **Dimension Jekyll Theme** ✨  
This site showcases my projects in **medical research** and **data analysis using R**.

🔬 I’m a clinical pharmacist with a strong interest in turning real-world healthcare data into meaningful insights.  
🧠 I'm currently building a portfolio of reproducible projects using R, including visualizations and PDF reports.
